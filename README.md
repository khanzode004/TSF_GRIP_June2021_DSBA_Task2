# TSF_GRIP_June2021_DSBA_Task2
This is the Task 2 I did in my time as Data Science &amp; Business Analytics Intern in The Spark Foundation GRIP program in June 2021.
This task consists of prediction using unsupervised machine learning model (K-Means Clustering). 
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, we have to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
